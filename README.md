# GradeTracker
A self updating grade and assessment scheduler for students.

All universities and schools has an online application for students to view their assignments and grades. However, these programs never provide the students with all the vital information they need to have confidence in their academic ability and progress through their education. This I why I am working towards a simpler and smarter way for students to track grades, averages, assignments and course progress.

- Combining SQL, C# and Python applications to develop an assignment and grade storing system.
- Researched for technical functions to further develop the application
- Learning about areas such as web scraping to improve useability
